# LinkForge — Milestone Roadmap

LinkForge is one application. It is not a group of separate projects.

At the start, LinkForge is one container behind a load balancer. Each milestone adds more infrastructure to the same application. At the end, LinkForge is a platform with many accounts, asynchronous events, monitoring, and cost control.

Each milestone adds only the infrastructure that the application needs at that time.

## Why this project uses one application

Each separate AWS project needs the same basic parts. These parts are a VPC, the IAM roles, a state backend, a build step, and a deploy path. You must build these parts before the project does useful work.

This project builds these parts one time, in milestone `v0-bootstrap`. Each milestone after `v0-bootstrap` adds only the new parts.

The result is that this project covers many AWS services in a short time. Separate projects use most of that time on the same basic parts.

## About the infrastructure code

This document gives the Terraform design in words. It does not give the HCL code.

For each milestone, the text tells you which resources to use. The text also tells you how the resources connect, and which arguments are important. The purpose is to learn the resource graph.

The application code in the container is simple. It is not the subject of this project.
